Contributor Guidelines â€“ AI Agents Portal

Welcome to the AI Agents Portal project! ðŸŽ‰

To ensure smooth collaboration and keep the existing version intact, please follow these guidelines when contributing code.


ðŸ”¹ Branching Strategy

main branch â†’ Always stable & production-ready.


Feature branches â†’ All new development must be done in separate branches.


Naming convention:


feature/<short-description> â†’ for new features (e.g. feature/portal-v2, feature/dark-theme)


bugfix/<short-description> â†’ for bug fixes (e.g. bugfix/login-button)

ðŸ”¹ Workflow

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/KrishnnambalSundaram/AgentPortal.git
cd AgentPortal


Checkout latest main

- git checkout main
- git pull origin main


Create a new branch

- git checkout -b feature/portal-v2

Make your changes
Update code, run local tests, and verify builds.
Commit your changes

- git add .
- git commit -m "Description of changes made"
- Push your branch
- git push origin feature/portal-v2
Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to GitHub â†’ Open a PR from your branch â†’ main.
Add a short description of the changes.
Wait for review before merge.

ðŸ”¹ Versioning

Each stable release will be tagged (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.0.0).

Always make sure your branch is based on the latest main before creating a PR.

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/portal-v2
git rebase main

ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

Keep PRs small and focused.
Write clear commit messages.
Do not push directly to main.
Always run npm run build locally before pushing to ensure no build breaks.

ðŸ‘‰ This way, your current portal (v1) stays intact in main, and all new work (v2, features, fixes) happens in isolated branches until approved.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
